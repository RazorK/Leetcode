# Dynamic Programming

### Basic Idea:
- Divide problem into small sub problem(same idea as Divide and Conquer).
- Use memory to record the result of each sub problem
    + some time, if each value in the memory are used only once, we can reduce the size of memory (Problem 62, 64, 70).
- When using DP, if there are some cases that we need to discuss seperately, sometimes add null to the board may solve the problem.
    + eg. 95 FromLC.java.
- Two dimention DP.
    + eg. 123.
